* For this project
** DONE Create a random generator library 
   AIM: Decouple random generation from actual algorithms
        This should help handle issues relating to the prime number generator
        We could indeed make the number generator smarter so it guess primes
        better. Therefore there is potential to make the algorithm faster
** DONE Create and use fast-if-function if it improves performance
** TODO Prime factorisation function
   AIM: Create a fast prime factorisation algorithm that handles 
        massive numbers. 
** TODO Primitive root search algorithm
   AIM: Finds primitive root modulu n so we can create a representation 
        for the multiplicative group Z/nZ
